# How to prepare for this workshop

## Hardware and Software Requirements

Participants will be sent instructions on connecting to the virtual compute
environment for the course once they register. No software beyond a modern web
browser is required. A laptop (not a tablet or chromebook) is required to
follow along with tutorials during the course. Registered participants are also
welcome to come and just observe if they wish.

If you wish to run the tutorials outside of the course, instructions on doing so
can be found at the course's [GitHub repository]({{ site.githuburl }}).


## Required Skills and Where to Get Them

### Data Science Skills

Participants are expected to be modestly comfortable with basic data science
tools including git, the Unix shell, and Python. Expertise is not required. The
links below provide resources for learning these skills prior to the
workshop. If you are comfortable with the [Software Carpentry
lessons](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/), you will likely have no
trouble following the workshop's tutorials.
  
The Software carpentry lesson plans can be found at the following links for
those who prefer reading through the tutorials. Video recordings of the related
tutorials by Software Carpentry are also linked for those who prefer to watch
them.

### Neuroscience Skills

Participants will get the most out of this workshop if they are comfortable with
several basic visual neuroscience topics. Expertise is not required, just
familiarity. We recommend this excellent online 
[course on the Human Brain](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyGKBDfnk-iAQx4Kw9JeVqspbg77sfAK0)
by Prof. Nancy Kanwisher (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), in particular
episodes
[2.11 (fMRI)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lLPeCNOpgA&list=PLyGKBDfnk-iAQx4Kw9JeVqspbg77sfAK0&index=16),
[3.4 (LGN &amp; V1)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvxlN2_bTzY&list=PLyGKBDfnk-iAQx4Kw9JeVqspbg77sfAK0&index=28),
[3.5 (Retinotopic Maps)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhFJIgeY-ZY&list=PLyGKBDfnk-iAQx4Kw9JeVqspbg77sfAK0&index=29),
and [3.8 (Beyond V1: Lots of Visual Areas)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqh9P_nVEMc&list=PLyGKBDfnk-iAQx4Kw9JeVqspbg77sfAK0&index=32).

We also recommend the first few episodes of a YouTube playlist by Prof. Jamie
Ward (University of Sussex) for participants who would like a quick refresh on
fMRI and visual cortex basics.
