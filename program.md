# Workshop Program

The workshop will take place during the 2024 Vision Sciences Society meeting on
Monday, May 20th, from 2:00-5:00pm in the Banyan/Citrus room. (The workshop is
neither sponsored nor endorsed by VSS.) The program will consist of three
presentations, each lasting slightly under an hour, with short breaks between.

**The goal of this program is to introduce participants to contemporary data
science/neuroscience software tools and to give them enough initial experience
to be able to apply them in their own research.** We cannot teach everything
about any tool in a three hour workshop, but through hands-on tutorials and
follow-along coding, we intend to help participants past the hardest part of the
learning process: getting starting. In addition to learning about neuroscience
software, participants will receive 1 month of access to a virtual compute
environment preconfigured using the [Neurodesk](https://neurodesk.org/) platform
with the software discussed in the workshop. Use of this compute environment
requies only a modern web browser and a GitHub username. Tutorials and lectures
will be made available to the public.

**Tutorials for the course will be made public in the [accompanying GitHub
repository]({{side.githuburl}}).** See the README file there for information on
running them either using the workshop's compute environment or on your own.
Lecture recordings will also be posted here.
