## About this Workshop

Visual neuroimaging has never been as powerful or as complex as it is
today. Fortunately, the increase in software complexity in recent years has been
accompanied by the development of powerful tools to automate pipelines, ensure
reproducibility, and simplify software and lab management. **This workshop,
conducted as a satellite event at the 2024 annual meeting of the [Vision
Sciences Society](https://www.visionsciences.org/), will introduce the
participants to these tools and live-code practical tutorials in their use.**
The session will focus on computational approaches to MRI work, but substantial
portions will be applicable to other neuroimaging methods.

As part of registration, all participants will be given access to a cloud-based
computing environment running [Neurodesk](https://www.neurodesk.org/) on which
all tutorials can be performed (a contemporary web-browser is all that is
required for participants to use this interface).  Participants will have access
to the compute environment for at least one month after VSS ends, and tutorials
and lecture recordings will be made public.

Neurodesk is an open source platform that includes many standard neuroscience
software tools and provides them via a browser-based interface. Users can a
command-line, a [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) interface, or a graphical
desktop, without needing to install anything but a modern web-browser. Because
the Neurodesk server runs in either a [Docker](https://docker.org/) or
[Singularity](https://sylabs.io/singularity/) container, installation is
simple. It and the tools demonstrated in this workshop can be used as easily on
a lab server, on a personal laptop, or in the cloud.

## Who is the intended audience?

This workshop is intended for researchers at all levels including students,
post-docs, and principal investigators. Participants are expected to have some
experience with the simple data science tools such as `git`, the unix shell, and
Python. Advanced knowledge is not required, and participants can easily learn
these skills from resources on the [preparation page]({{ site.baseurl
}}/prep).
