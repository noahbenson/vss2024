![How to Stop Worrying and Love Neuroimaging of the Visual Cortex](images/header.webp "How to stop worrying...")

---

Visual neuroimaging has never been as powerful or as complex as it is
today. Fortunately, the increase in software complexity in recent years has been
accompanied by the development of powerful tools to automate pipelines, ensure
reproducibility, and simplify software and lab management. **This workshop,
conducted as a satellite event at the 2024 annual meeting of the [Vision
Sciences Society](https://www.visionsciences.org/), will introduce the
participants to these tools and live-code practical tutorials in their use.**
The session will focus on computational approaches to MRI work, but substantial
portions will be applicable to other neuroimaging methods.

As part of registration, all participants will be given access to a cloud-based
computing environment running [Neurodesk](https://www.neurodesk.org/) on which
all tutorials can be performed (a contemporary web-browser is all that is
required for participants to use this interface).  Participants will have access
to the compute environment for at least one month after VSS ends, and tutorials
and lecture recordings will be made public. Neurodesk is an open source platform
that includes many standard neuroscience software tools and provides them via a
browser-based interface. Users can interface with it via the command-line, a
[Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) interface, or a graphical desktop, all
accessible using only a web-browser. Because Neurodesk runs in either a
[Docker](https://docker.org/) or [Singularity](https://sylabs.io/singularity/)
container, installation is simple.

        <p>Dr. Schira is currently a Senior Lecturer in the School of Psychology at
        the University of Wollongong. He has a Dr. rer. nat. (Doctorate in
        Natural Sciences) in Human Neurobiology from the University of Bremen
        and Charité; University Hospital in Berlin. Mark began his research lab
        at the University of Wollongong in 2013.</td></tr></table>

        <p>Noah Benson is a senior data scientist at the University of
        Washington’s eScience Institute. He received his B.S. from Purdue
        University where triple-majored in computer science, math, and biology
        (2001-2005) and his Ph.D. in biomedical and health informatics from the
        University of Washington where he studied the analysis and
        representation of molecular dynamics simulations (2005-2010). Since
        graduating, Noah has worked primarily in the domain of human
        neuroscience and vision with an emphasis on understanding the
        relationship between the anatomical structure of the brain and its
        function. He has worked as a post-doctoral associate at the University
        of Pennsylvania (2010-2014) and a research scientist at New York
        University (2014-2020).</td>

        <p>I am a postdoc at the Computational Imaging Group, led by Steffen
        Bollmann. I recently finished my Ph.D. in Computational Imaging at UQ.
        Specifically, my Ph.D. work involved predicting the functional
        organization of the human visual cortex from underlying anatomy using
        geometric deep learning. To tackle this and other research questions, I
        am leveraging my interdisciplinary background in Biophysics (Bachelor's
        degree; University of Sao Paulo, Brazil), Neuroscience (Master's degree;
        Federal University of ABC, Brazil), and now the intersection of AI and
        imaging. I am interested in (geometric) deep learning, vision,
        neuroscience, and explainable and fair AI research.</td></tr></table>
