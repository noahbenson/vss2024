        <p>Noah Benson is a senior data scientist at the University of
        Washingtonâ€™s eScience Institute. He received his B.S. from Purdue
        University where triple-majored in computer science, math, and biology
        (2001-2005) and his Ph.D. in biomedical and health informatics from the
        University of Washington where he studied the analysis and
        representation of molecular dynamics simulations (2005-2010). Since
        graduating, Noah has worked primarily in the domain of human
        neuroscience and vision with an emphasis on understanding the
        relationship between the anatomical structure of the brain and its
        function. He has worked as a post-doctoral associate at the University
        of Pennsylvania (2010-2014) and a research scientist at New York
        University (2014-2020).</p>

        <p>Dr. Schira is currently a Senior Lecturer in the School of Psychology at
        the University of Wollongong. He has a Dr. rer. nat. (Doctorate in
        Natural Sciences) in Human Neurobiology from the University of Bremen
        and Charit&eacute;; University Hospital in Berlin. Mark began his research lab
        at the University of Wollongong in 2013.</p>

        <p>I am a postdoc at the Computational Imaging Group, led by Steffen
        Bollmann. I recently finished my Ph.D. in Computational Imaging at UQ.
        Specifically, my Ph.D. work involved predicting the functional
        organization of the human visual cortex from underlying anatomy using
        geometric deep learning. To tackle this and other research questions, I
        am leveraging my interdisciplinary background in Biophysics (Bachelor's
        degree; University of Sao Paulo, Brazil), Neuroscience (Master's degree;
        Federal University of ABC, Brazil), and now the intersection of AI and
        imaging. I am interested in (geometric) deep learning, vision,
        neuroscience, and explainable and fair AI research.</p>
